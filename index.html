                    <p>Welcome to the Academy of Baseball, a club organization based in the San Diego North County area and run by Classical Academy coaches. We are dedicated to developing young athletes with a focus on high school and college preparation, and are excited to offer competitive teams with limited rosters for players aged 12U through 18U.</p>
                    
                    <p>At the Academy of Baseball, our mission is to foster team cohesion as a key differentiator from other club programs, where there is often a lot of family and player movement from season to season. We aim for our players to stay together as they progress through high school, believing that consistency and camaraderie are essential for developing not only skilled athletes but also lifelong friendships.</p>
                    
                    <p>In alignment with <a href="https://5toolahc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 Tool Hitting Center</a> and the <a href="https://www.koreperform.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KORE Performance facility</a> (inside 5 Tool San Marcos), we focus on training baseball-relevant athleticism, providing our players with the tools they need to excel both on and off the field. Our year-round program guarantees consistent club play, allowing athletes to hone their skills and improve their game throughout the entire year.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Program Details and Costs</h3>
                    
                    <p>We offer 3 levels of participation, which vary in cost and commitment. Note that each age group is intended to be a continuous cohort of approximately 30-40 players. The levels are not designed to be a "tryout" based hierarchy, but rather a fluid system that allows for players to move in and out of more time-intensive squads in alignment with their schedule and interest. Note that, depending on enrollment numbers within each age group, not all levels of partipation may be available across all seasons. When this is the case, we work with the families and players to determine the optimal plan and price structure that meets their needs.</p>

                    <h4>Field Practice Level</h4>
                    
                    <p>We realize that many players participate in multiple sports; we encourage this, as it allows you to be the best athlete you can be. With that in mind, we offer a field practice program that promotes fundamental baseball development and cohort cohesion. This level features 2 field practices per week. Players/families at this level will be made aware of aligned tournament or scrimmage opportunies that arise under the AoB umbrella with any extra costs, when applicable, clearly communicated.</p>

                    <h4>Field + Batting Practice Level</h4>
                    <p>This level adds a weekly batting practice at the 5 Tool facility to the 2 field practices per week. A monthly membership to the 5 Tool Hitting Center is also included. This membership provides the opportunity for 1/2 hour of tunnel time at the facility per day, accommodating those players seeking extra hitting reps beyond the scheduled practices. Scrimmages and tournaments will be available to these players, with any associated costs communicated in advance when applicable.</p>

                    <h4>Field + Batting + KORE Workouts Level</h4>
                    <p>This is the most demanding level, with all field/batting practices and workouts included in the other levels, plus 2 KORE Performance facility workouts per week. These workouts target baseball aligned athleticism and strength training, and serve as a key accelerator to overall athlete development and success. Players at this level get priority to RSVP for scrimmage and tournament rosters.</p>
