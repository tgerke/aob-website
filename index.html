                    <p>Welcome to the Academy of Baseball, a new club organization based in the San Diego North County area and run by Classical Academy coaches. We are dedicated to developing young athletes with a focus on high school and college preparation, and are excited to offer competitive teams with limited rosters for players aged 11u, 12u, 13u, 14u, 16u, and 18u</p>
                    
                    <p>At the Academy of Baseball, our mission is to foster team cohesion as a key differentiator from other club programs, where there is often a lot of family and player movement from season to season. We aim for our players to stay together as they progress through high school, believing that consistency and camaraderie are essential for developing not only skilled athletes but also lifelong friendships.</p>
                    
                    <p>In alignment with <a href="https://5toolahc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 Tool Hitting Center</a> and the <a href="https://www.koreperform.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KORE Performance facility</a> (inside 5 Tool San Marcos), we focus on training baseball-relevant athleticism, providing our players with the tools they need to excel both on and off the field. Our year-round program guarantees consistent club play, allowing athletes to hone their skills and improve their game throughout the entire year.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Program Details and Costs</h3>
                    
                    <p>We offer 3 levels of participation, which are delineated and priced by squad. Note that each age group is intended to be a continuous cohort of approximately 30-40 players. The squads are not designed to be a "tryout" based hierarchy, but rather a fluid system that allows for players to move in and out of more time-intensive squads in alignment with their schedule and interest.</p>

                    <h4>Practice Squad</h4>
                    
                    <p>We realize that many players participate in multiple sports; we encourage this, as it allows you to be the best athlete you can be. With that in mind, we offer a practice squad program that promotes further baseball development and cohort cohesion during the "off-season." During this time, 1 field practice and 1 batting cage practice can keep a player sharp during the off-season. Players/families on the Practice Squad or Development Squad can create a "Satellite Team" under AoB and enter into tournaments or scrimmages if desired. Limited space is available - just 12 roster spots for each age division. Practices start July 1st.</p>

                    <h4>Development Squad</h4>
                    <p>For those who want to transform their athleticism while leveling up their baseball skills and IQ, 1 field practice, 1 batting cage practice, 2 workouts weekly can help you achieve your development goals. Limited space is available - just 12 roster spots for each age division. Practices and workouts start July 1st.</p>

                    <h4>Tournament Squad</h4>
                    <p>Tournament Squads are the most demanding squad, with all field/batting practices and workouts included in the Development Squad, plus 2 to 3 tournaments per month. Limited space is available - just 12 roster spots for each age division. Tryouts are June 19th and 20th.</p>
