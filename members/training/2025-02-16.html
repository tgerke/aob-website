            <p>By now, it should be no secret that our 12u philosophy does not emphasise Win/Loss record as our primary objective. Instead, what we value most is our ability and desire to <em>compete</em>. While competing may sound a lot like hunting for wins, it is different in important ways.</p>
            
            <!-- MAIN CONTENT SECTIONS -->
            <h2>Underdogs with fight</h2>
            <p>Let's talk about the Dodgers and Angels. Last year, the Dodgers paid their players around $400 million. Compare this to the Angels, who had about half as much money to spend, paying their players around $200 million. We all know the Dodgers were the best team in baseball last year, and you'll often hear that this is because of how much money they can spend.</p>
            <p>With that in mind, how do you think the Dodgers did in their 6 games against Angels last year? If they spent twice as much money, you might guess they won twice as many games, going 4-2.</p>
            <p>Wrong. They were 0-6, with the Angels winning all 6 games. Why? I truly believe the Angels showed up to this series with a stronger desire to <em>compete</em> against their local rivals. Nearly everyone thought the Dodgers would dominate, having the best payroll and arguably one of the best rosters in history. The Angels refused to believe this and shocked us all.</p>
            <p>I know we have some Dodgers fans here, so put those feelings aside when thinking about the following question: Which team would you rather play for in this series and why? If you're being honest, you'd probably say the Angels. And this is not just because they won the most (which of course is fine to enjoy!). Think about the energy shared between those players even after they won the first game. The grit and determination to show up the next day and do it again. That's the fun stuff.</p>
            <p>Make no mistake: despite the series sweep, virtually no one thought the Angels would end up in the World Series, and very few people thought that the series sweep would keep the Dodgers out of the World Series. And here we see the difference between competing and winning games. On average, the better resourced team is likely to have a solid Win/Loss record and go deep in the playoffs; but the underdog team is also full of legitimate big league players who are working to improve their own trajectory, who are going to show up consistently, and can beat anybody on a given day.</p>

            <h2>What this means for us</h2>
            <p>Yesterday, we played a team with better resources than us. Their organization, which is pretty representative of most travel organizations in the Southern California area, has about 35 kids in each age bracket spread across multiple teams, with age brackets ranging from 8u to 14u (meaning there about 250 across the program at a given time, and this doesn't count the kids who did not make the cut in tryouts). Our 12u squad is only in its second season, and consists almost entirely of players in our middle school network, plus some players who are branching out from Fallbrook Youth Baseball. This is a much smaller pool than can be recruited by an organization that has visibly competed in San Diego tournaments with big squads for decades now.</p>
            <p>Does that mean we cannot beat that team? Is the reason they won yesterday because they are better resourced? <em>NO!</em></p>
            <p>The reason they won yesterday is because they <em>competed</em> with far greater intent than us. They made several diving plays on defense, their body language when they come up to bat told you that they knew they were ready to crush, and their focus and awareness of the game never let up for a second (even when the game was far out of reach for us). We did not execute those things as well, and that's what we will be improving.</p>
            
            <!-- CLOSING SECTION -->
            <h2>You are in control</h2>
            <p>Here's the best part: your desire to compete is entirely in your control. Things we cannot control include the quality of the umpire, how good or well-resourced the other team is, the length of the grass in the outfield, the infield dirt, the sun in your eyes at the wrong time of day, the mound height, the list goes on and on... I don't care if we're playing against the Dodgers on the sorriest excuse for a sandlot field in the middle of a hurricane; we will dive for balls, sprint through first on dinkers, lift up our teammates, and never give up on a play. That's how you compete, and as a bonus, this does often translate to wins.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>This Week's Challenge</h3>
                <p>Reflect on your performance yesterday. When on defense: what were you thinking between plays? Were you locked in, communicating with your teammates about where to position, what you saw from the batter last time? Did you have an opportunity to sprint and dive for a ball that you want back? When hitting: what were you thinking about when you stepped into the box? "Is this pitcher going to be wild and throw balls?" or "I'm going to bang whatever he sends me off the fence?" Mentally prepare yourself to improve next Sunday.</p>
